# fabric-chaincode-net

Direct .NET port from [fabric-chaincode-java](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-java)

`Very Alpha`

Porting is done and unit tests are passing.

Need to figure out how to integrate this in [fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)
and then integrating the .net chaincode source and/or compiled uploads into [.NET SDK](https://github.com/maxpiva/fabric-sdk-net)

Help is appreciated since i'm not proficient in GO language

`Tidbits`

Fabric 1.2 May support upload compiled chaincodes.

net source code can be run interpreted with dotnet.exe
